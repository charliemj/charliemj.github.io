        <p>I'm currently working as a part engineer, part scientist doing UI/UX research and development at <a href="http://cra.com">Charles River Analytics</a> in the Human Effectiveness division.</p>

        <p>I graduated from MIT with a double major in Computer Science and Engineering and <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu">Comparative Media Studies</a> in June 2017. I am currently the Publisher of the MIT’s student newspaper, <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/Charlie-moore"><i>The Tech</i></a> (previously a reporter and editor). I do my best to adhere to AP style guidelines (and to use the Oxford comma) and to thoroughly comment my code.</p>

        <p>I have experience in full stack development and UI/UX design. I'm particularly excited about working on interdisciplinary projects related to the intersection of technology, society, and culture, especially projects related to journalism, music, and storytelling. I work well in teams containing a mix of technical and non-technical folks.</p>

        <p>From fall 2017 to spring 2018, I served as a teaching assistant for MIT's Fundamentals of Programming (6.009), where I helped teach intermediate-level software engineering concepts using Python to over 400 students. Before that, I spent a summer as a research assistant on the <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> and Artificial Intelligence teams at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society</a> at Harvard University.</p>

        <p>I'm currently really interested in data visualization, storytelling, and VR/AR UX.</p>
