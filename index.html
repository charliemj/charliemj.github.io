        <p>I'm currently an M.Eng. student in <a href="http://eecs.mit.edu">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a> concentrating in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from MIT with a double major in Computer Science and Engineering and <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu">Comparative Media Studies</a> June 2017. In my free time, I am a reporter and editor for MIT’s newspaper, <a href="https://thetech.com"><i>The Tech</i></a>. I do my best to adhere to AP style guidelines and to thoroughly comment my code.<p>

        <p>I have experience in full stack development and UI/UX design -- I'll work on any part of the stack given the right project. I'm particularly excited about working on interdisciplinary projects related to the intersection of technology and society, especially journalism. I have experience in teaching and I'm a good explainer. I am comfortable explaining complex ideas in simple terms to a variety of audiences -- I work well in teams containing a mix of technical and non-technical folks.</p>

        <p>I'm currently a teaching assistant for MIT's Fundamentals of Programming (6.009) class, where I help teach intermediate-level software engineering concepts using python to over 400 students.</p>

        <p>I was a research intern on the <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> and Artificial Intelligence teams at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society</a> at Harvard University in the summer of 2017. I wrote and designed educational resources to make the science behind AI technologies more accessible to non-technical audiences.</p>

        <p>I interned at <a href="http://brilliant.org">Brilliant</a> during the spring and summer of 2016 as a computer science writing intern. Brilliant is a company that hosts interactive educational STEM content for 4 million users worldwide. I wrote over 60 wiki pages teaching algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software concepts.</p>

        <p>Check out my <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> page to see more info about various software projects I've contributed to.</p>
