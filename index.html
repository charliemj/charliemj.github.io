        <p><img id="headshot" src="assets/img/kar.jpg" alt="Karleigh Moore"> I’m Karleigh Moore and I’m a writer and software engineer currently based in Cambridge, MA. In June 2017, I’ll be graduating from <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a> with a double major in <a href="http://eecs.mit.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu">Comparative Media Studies</a>. In my free time, I am a reporter and editor for MIT’s newspaper, <a href="https://thetech.com"><i>The Tech</i></a>.<p>

        <p>I’m interested in full stack development and UI/UX design, and I'm particularly interested in working on interdisciplinary projects related to the intersection of technology and society. Through my media studies coursework and research, I have experience with user design, visual design, and data visualization. On the engineering side, I have a background in programming, algorithms, and theoretical computer science.</p>

        </p>I’ve worked as an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://ccimit.mit.edu/">Creative Communities Initiative</a> group at MIT. My research focus was mixing quantitative research methods with ethnography in order to study fandom and fan behavior in online spaces.</p>

        <p>I interned at <a href="http://brilliant.org">Brilliant</a> during the spring and summer of 2016 as a computer science writing intern. Brilliant is a company that hosts interactive educational STEM content for 4 million users worldwide. I wrote over 60 wiki pages teaching algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software concepts.</p>
