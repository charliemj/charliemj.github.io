        <p>I graduated from MIT with a double major in Computer Science and Engineering and <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu">Comparative Media Studies</a> June 2017. I am currently the Chairman (Publisher/CEO) for MIT’s student newspaper, <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/Charlie-moore"><i>The Tech</i></a> (previously a reporter and editor). I do my best to adhere to AP style guidelines (and to use the Oxford comma) and to thoroughly comment my code.</p>

        <p>I have experience in full stack development and UI/UX design — I'll work on any part of the stack given the right project. I'm particularly excited about working on interdisciplinary projects related to the intersection of technology and society, especially journalism. I have experience teaching and I'm a good explainer. I am comfortable explaining complex ideas in simple terms to a variety of audiences — I work well in teams containing a mix of technical and non-technical folks.</p>

        <p>I'm currently a fall software engineering intern at Datto Inc working on a cloud-based SaaS product for data backups. In this role, I'm learning Scala and Ruby, writing lots of tests, and squashing lots of bugs.</p>

        <p>From fall 2017 to spring 2018, I served as a teaching assistant for MIT's Fundamentals of Programming (6.009), where I helped teach intermediate-level software engineering concepts using Python to over 400 students.</p>

        <p>During the summer of 2017, I was a research intern on the <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> and Artificial Intelligence teams at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society</a> at Harvard University in the summer of 2017. I wrote and designed educational resources to make the science behind AI technologies more accessible to non-technical audiences.</p>

        <!-- <p>I interned at <a href="http://brilliant.org">Brilliant</a> during the spring and summer of 2016 as a computer science writing intern. Brilliant is a company that hosts interactive educational STEM content for 4 million users worldwide. I wrote over 60 wiki pages teaching algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software concepts.</p> -->

        <p>Check out my <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> page to see more info about various software projects I've contributed to.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include reading, making music, running, crafting, and watching science fiction TV shows.</p>
