<p><img id="headshot" src="/assets/img/kjm.jpg">I’m Karleigh Moore and I’m a software engineer currently based in Cambridge, MA. In June 2017, I’ll be graduating from [MIT](http://mit.edu) with a double major in [Computer Science](http://eecs.mit.edu) and [Comparative Media Studies](http://cmsw.mit.edu). In my free time, I am a reporter and editor for MIT’s newspaper, [<i>The Tech</i>](http://thetech.com).</p>

I’m interested in full stack development and UI/UX design. Through my media studies coursework and research, I have experience with user design, visual design, and data visualization. On the engineering side, I have a background in programming, algorithms, and theoretical computer science.

Right now, I’m working as an undergraduate researcher in the [Creative Communities Initiative](http://ccimit.mit.edu/) group at MIT. My research focus is mixing quantitative research methods with ethnography in order to study fandom and fan behavior in online spaces.

I just finished up an internship at [Brilliant](http://brilliant.org) as a computer science writing intern. Brilliant is a company that hosts interactive educational STEM content for 2 million users worldwide. I wrote over 60 wiki pages teaching algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software concepts.
