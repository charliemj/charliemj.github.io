	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Long Haul</h1>
	<p>I’m Karleigh Moore and I’m a software engineer currently based in Cambridge, MA. In June 2017, I’ll be graduating from MIT with a double major in Computer Science and Comparative Media Studies. In my free time, I am a reporter and editor for MIT’s newspaper, The Tech.</p> 

  <p>I’m interested in full stack development and UI/UX design. Through my media studies coursework and research, I have experience with user design, visual design, and data visualization. On the engineering side, I have a background in programming, algorithms, and theoretical computer science.</p> 

  <p>Right now, I’m working as an undergraduate researcher in the Creative Communities Initiative group at MIT. My research focus is mixing quantitative research methods with ethnography in order to study fandom and fan behavior in online spaces.</p>

  <p>I just finished up an internship at Brilliant as a computer science writing intern. Brilliant is a company that hosts interactive educational STEM content for 2 million users worldwide. I wrote over 60 wiki pages teaching algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software concepts.</p>
