	<h1>CMS Coursework</h1>

	<h3>News Connect</h3>

	<p>I helped to create News Connect, a webapp for visualizing international news as a final project in CMS.633 Digital Humanities at MIT spring 2015. I didn't touch any code for this project, but I helped design the UI, creating wireframes and mockups, protoyping, and user testing.</p>

	<h3>Tourist Ants</h3>

	<p>Tourist Ants is an idea for an app to help touists and locals alike. In CMS.622 Applying Media Technologies, my team and I devised an app that would help route tourists to popular destinations while minimizing obstructions to locals (such as MIT students looking to get to class on time!). Due to time constraints and the nature of the project, Tourist Ants is mostly a thought-app — no code was written. I helped create wireframes, mockups, and conducted user research.</p>

	<h3>Career Fair Crisis</h3>

	<p>Career Fair Crisis is a board game designed to get MIT students thinking about the biases (intended or not) present in the MIT Fall Career Fair. My team submitted a prototype game board, rules, and pieces for the "Game Design" component of CMS.622 Applying Media Technologies in fall 2015. I helped to create game rules, the board, and game pieces. I assisted in user testing. We sourced some of the card text from email list threads and "MIT Gothic" stories.</p>
